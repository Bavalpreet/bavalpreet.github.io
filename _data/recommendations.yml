    I had the pleasure of working with Baval on an AI chatbot project. He was
    the lead data scientist on a small team we'd contracted for support and we
    worked closely together for a little over a year. First, I cannot express how
    much of a pleasure it is to simply know Baval. He is extremely kind, patient,
    and always has a great attitude. This was important to our time working
    together because he often had to communicate very technical information to
    myself and other stakeholders who didn't have the same knowledge and
    understanding that another data scientist or developer would have. I
    appreciate his ability to not only break down complex ideas, but to ask
    insightful questions in return as well. Baval was able to use his Machine
    Learning and AI expertise and knowledge to advance our chatbot in deeply
    impactful ways. He implemented RASA for our automated chatbot, which was
    something we struggled to accomplish internally for several months. This
    implementation was a huge development on the conversational aspect of our
    bot, as we were able to more accurately respond to certain inquiries and
    train it even with more complex utterances than we had in the past. In
    additional to his technical communication skills, Baval was very dependable
    and timely with project deliverables. And despite working in vastly different
    time zones, I knew that he would be available and show up for our stand up
    calls. He would often surprise me with his dedication to our project as well,
    as there were times when I would assume given his time zone he would be
    sleeping or clocked out, but I would sometimes find him online or receive a
    question or small update posted in JIRA or Slack from him. Thank you Baval
    for your incredible work and for being simply and incredible person to know!
    Wishing you all the best.

    Bavalpreet is a dedicated, hard-working individual who always strives to go

    projects with Bavalpreet, I can attest that he has been an instrumental
    ‘translator’ of issues from a technical to a business perspective and has
    been key in offering tailored solutions for clients. He demonstrated his
    expertise in various domains of data science, conversational AI, natural
    language processing (NLP), and computer vision. He has worked on various
    problems like classification, regression, paraphrasing, etc. He has a strong
    foundation in programming languages such as Python and databases such as SQL
    and MongoDB. During his tenure at our company, he works on several projects
    that showcased his exceptional analytical skills and problem-solving
    abilities. One of his significant achievements was developing a conversational
    AI chatbot for various local governments using AWS LEX and RASA. He also
    built a multilingual conversational AI bot that covers different crops
    cultivated on multiple farmlands. Additionally, he has experience in
    scraping data using BeautifulSoup and Selenium and building named entity
    recognition (NER) systems for boat companies. As a mentor, he built an image
    segmentation model for road scene analysis and performed exploratory data
    analysis of New York City for a client’s sales department. He has also
    authored several research publications and blogs, including an efficient
    deep-learning model for named entity recognition for the Punjabi language. I
    highly recommend Bavalpreet Singh for any future work or educational projects
    that he will undertake!
